# SSUI-React-Final-Project
 
This is a character creator made using React, Javascript, JSX, and CSS.  You may need to have React installed on your computer before attempting to run this, and you will need to have Node JS installed to use the npm command.

How to run this project:

1. In VSCode (or another IDE), open the character-creator directory in the integrated terminal.
2. Type "npm run start" without quotes.  This should start the project running on port 3000.
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ if it was not opened automatically.
4. Have fun using the app!

To close the server when you are done, go to the integrated terminal and press Ctrl + C to kill it.
